# Changelog — Codebase Memory V2

## 0.12.6 — Round 59 (2026-07-07) code quality + type safety in sqlite-ro.ts

No bugs fixed — same pattern as R58 but applied to the code graph reader
(`v2/src/bridge/sqlite-ro.ts`). Zero functional changes, zero test regressions.

### Type safety (MEDIUM) — 30 `as any` casts removed

- **11 row type interfaces added**: `CodeNodeRow`, `NeighborRow`, `DegreeCountRow`,
  `CountRow`, `CountAllRow`, `LabelCountRow`, `TypeCountRow`, `EdgeTripleRow`,
  `BulkEdgeRow`, `ProjectNameRow`, `ProjectRow`. These match what SQLite actually
  returns for each query shape (simple SELECT *, JOINs with aliases, COUNT
  aggregations, GROUP BY, etc.).
- **All 30 `as any` casts replaced** with proper row types: `as CodeNodeRow | undefined`,
  `as NeighborRow[]`, `as DegreeCountRow[]`, `as CountRow`, `as CountAllRow`,
  `as LabelCountRow[]`, `as TypeCountRow[]`, `as EdgeTripleRow[]`, `as BulkEdgeRow[]`,
  `as ProjectNameRow[]`, `as ProjectRow[]`, etc.
- **`deserializeCodeNode(row: CodeNodeRow)`** — previously typed as `(row: any)`.
- **`makeEdge(row: BulkEdgeRow)`** in getBulkNeighbors — previously `(row: any)`.
- **`tryPush(row: EdgeTripleRow, ...)`** in getBulkEdges — previously `(row: any)`.
- **`params: any[]`** in findNodesByName and listNodes replaced with `(string | number)[]`.
- **Null safety**: `NeighborRow.node_properties` is `string | null` (LEFT JOIN may
  produce null). The getNeighbors method now coalesces with `?? '{}'` when passing
  to deserializeCodeNode, matching the existing `row.properties_json || '{}'` pattern
  in deserializeCodeNode itself.

### Performance (LOW-MEDIUM) — hot-path prepared statements

- **2 prepared statements moved to constructor**: `stmtGetNodeById`,
  `stmtFindNodeByQName`. These are the 2 single-row lookups called on every MCP
  tool invocation (prepare_edit_context, get_module_context, search_code_and_memory).
  better-sqlite3 caches internally, but holding the Statement object directly
  avoids the cache lookup + JS wrapper allocation on every call.

### Why this matters

`sqlite-ro.ts` is the read-only bridge to V1's code graph — every MCP tool, every
UI endpoint that shows code structure goes through `CodeGraphReader`. Before this
round, 30 `as any` casts meant the TypeScript compiler couldn't catch:
- Column-name typos (e.g. `row.edge_propertis` instead of `row.edge_properties`)
- Wrong alias names in JOIN queries (the getNeighbors aliases are critical —
  both tables have `id`, `project`, `properties_json`, and without aliases
  better-sqlite3 returns the last column value for duplicate names)
- Missing fields after a V1 schema change

With proper row types, these are all compile-time errors. The prepared-statement
optimization is minor but sets the pattern for future hot-path identification.

## 0.12.5 — Round 58 (2026-07-07) code quality + type safety + perf

No bugs fixed — this round focuses on code quality, type safety, and performance
in the DB layer (`v2/src/human/store.ts`). Zero functional changes, zero test
regressions.

### Type safety (MEDIUM) — 18 `as any` casts removed

- **6 row type interfaces added**: `HumanNodeRow`, `HumanEdgeRow`, `IdRow`,
  `CountRow`, `LabelCountRow`, `HumanNodeWithCbmIdRow`. These match what SQLite
  actually returns (JSON columns as `string`, not parsed arrays; label/status/
  source/type as `string`, not union types — the DB CHECK constraint guarantees
  validity, but TypeScript can't know that from the raw column type).
- **All 18 `as any` casts in query methods replaced** with proper row types:
  `as HumanNodeRow | undefined`, `as HumanEdgeRow[]`, `as CountRow`,
  `as LabelCountRow[]`, etc. The only remaining `as any` are 4 in
  `openMemory()` (accessing private fields from a static method — documented
  with a comment explaining why the alternative would be worse).
- **`deserializeNode(row: HumanNodeRow)`** and **`deserializeEdge(row: HumanEdgeRow)`**
  — previously typed as `(row: any)`. Now the compiler catches column-name typos
  at build time and the schema is self-documenting.
- **`safeJsonParseArray` return type** tightened from `any[]` to `unknown[]`.
  The `cbm_node_ids` filter now uses a type guard `(x): x is number => ...`
  instead of an unchecked `.filter()` returning `any[]`.
- **`params: any[]`** in `listNodes` and `updateNode` replaced with
  `(string | number)[]` and `(string | number | null)[]`.

### Performance (LOW-MEDIUM) — hot-path prepared statements

- **3 prepared statements moved to constructor**: `stmtGetNodeById`,
  `stmtGetNodeBySlug`, `stmtGetNodeByObsidianPath`. These are the 3 single-row
  lookups called on every MCP tool invocation, every UI dashboard load, and
  every sync cycle. better-sqlite3 caches prepared statements internally, but
  holding the Statement object directly avoids the cache lookup + JS wrapper
  allocation on every call. `openMemory()` (used by tests) also prepares them
  (after `runMigrations`, since the tables must exist first).

### Why this matters

The DB layer is the foundation of the entire V2 sidecar — every MCP tool, every
CLI command, every UI endpoint goes through `HumanMemoryStore`. Before this
round, the store had 22+ `as any` casts, meaning the TypeScript compiler
couldn't catch:
- Column-name typos (e.g. `row.cbm_node_id` instead of `row.cbm_node_ids`)
- Wrong return type assumptions (e.g. treating a JSON string as an array)
- Missing fields after a schema change

With proper row types, these are all compile-time errors. The prepared-statement
optimization is minor (better-sqlite3's cache is fast), but it makes the hot
path explicit and sets the pattern for future optimizations.

## 0.12.4 — Round 57 (2026-07-07) doc cleanup + private maintainers notes

Doc consistency + maintainability improvements (no code changes).

### Documentation cleanup (MEDIUM)

- **12 stale refs fixed** across v2/README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md:
  - v2/README.md: test count 374→378 (355+23), version refs 0.11.3→0.12.4, security section updated to mention R51/R55 symlink-safe realpath protection.
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: "6 tools"→"7 tools", "374 tests"→"378 tests", "5 docs files"→"9 files", "npm ci"→"npm install --no-audit --no-fund", removed stale "planned: 0.4.0" tag (we're at 0.12.4), rewrote CI/CD section to describe the actual GitLab→GitHub mirror workflow + required checks + cross-ref to MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md.
  - MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md: test count 376→378, round range R55→R56, commit message example updated.

### MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md enriched (MEDIUM)

- **Common pitfalls** section (9 items): "FIXED" claims that weren't fixed, stale version/test counts, YAML `: ` parsing, `--force-with-lease` URL push, workflow-level permissions, MR pipelines with zero jobs, unconditional setLoading, npm ci vs npm install, committing in wrong repo.
- **Pre-commit checklist** section (12 items): build, tests, version bump, CHANGELOG, doc consistency, YAML validation, regression test, commit message format, push options.
- **Lessons learned** section (6 items): environment reset recovery, GitLab API 403, paramiko slowness, sed over-replacement, branch protection, cd persistence.

### Private maintainers notes (LOW)

- **MAINTAINERS_NOTES.local.md** (gitignored via `*.local.md`): operational reminders, environment setup, env reset recovery steps, operational gotchas, token/variable locations (names only, not values), pre-session checklist. No actual secrets — just paths, URLs, and "things I keep forgetting". The SSH key PATH is mentioned (it's just a path), but the key VALUE never leaves the machine.

## 0.12.3 — Round 56 (2026-07-07) self-audit + MAINTAINERS_GUIDE

3 improvements from GLM self-audit (no external audit report this round).

### Test coverage (MEDIUM)

- **symlink escape test for assertPathInsideRoot**: R55 Part A wired up the
  shared `safe-path.ts` utility in `vault.ts` and `server.ts`, but the
  existing `vault.test.ts` only tested symlink loops (R51) — not the actual
  symlink-escape attack vector that `assertPathInsideRoot` is supposed to
  prevent. Added 2 tests: (1) symlink inside vault pointing outside is
  rejected by readNote/writeNote/deleteNote; (2) symlink inside vault
  pointing to another vault-internal path is allowed (no over-blocking).

### Code clarity (LOW)

- **backup.ts version field clarified**: `version: '0.10.3'` in the backup
  JSON was ambiguous — could be confused with the package version (0.12.2).
  Added a 10-line comment block explaining it's a schema version independent
  from the package version, bumped only when the JSON shape changes.

### Documentation (LOW)

- **MAINTAINERS_GUIDE.md** (new file): captures the workflow conventions,
  naming rules, required patterns (safe-path, -- separator, grep -wE,
  maxAliasCount), anti-patterns (force-without-lease, token in URL,
  unconditional setLoading, unquoted `: ` in YAML), CI/CD setup, test
  infrastructure, audit etiquette, and versioning rules accumulated across
  55 rounds. Public doc — for secrets/keys see local `MAINTAINERS_NOTES.local.md`.

## 0.12.2 — Round 55 (2026-07-07) Claude Sonnet 5 R9 audit

4 issues fixed from Claude Sonnet 5 Round 9 audit report (1 HIGH, 1 LOW, 2 LOW cleanup).

### HIGH fix (dead code + duplication risk)

- **Part A**: `v2/src/utils/safe-path.ts` was created in R53 (Part C of Round 8 audit) to de-duplicate the symlink-safe path resolution logic between `vault.ts` and `server.ts`, but neither call site was actually wired up to use it — both kept their own inline `realpathSync` implementations. The utility file's docstring claimed the wiring existed when it didn't. Round 8 specifically warned about this duplication risk. Fixed: `vault.ts`'s `assertPathInsideVault` replaced by the shared `assertPathInsideRoot` (3 call sites: `readNote`, `writeNote`, `deleteNote`); `server.ts`'s `routeBrowse` now uses `safeRealpath`, `routeIndex` now uses the new `safeRealpathStrict` (added to the utility for the strict 404-on-missing-path semantics `routeIndex` needs). The inline `realpathSync` import was removed from `server.ts`. `vault.ts`'s `walkVaultIter` keeps its own `realpathSync` call for symlink-loop detection (different semantics — `safeRealpath`'s fallback would defeat the skip-on-broken-symlink behaviour).

### HIGH fix (CI silently broken)

- **D3**: Round 52's workflow-level `permissions: contents: read` hardened `backend`/`frontend` correctly, but silently broke `quota-report`'s `/repos/.../actions/runs` API call — once any `permissions:` key is set at workflow level, every unlisted scope becomes `none`. The job's `total_count` parsing fell back to `0` instead of surfacing the 403. Fixed: `quota-report` now has its own job-level `permissions: { contents: read, actions: read }` override. `backend`/`frontend` stay at the workflow-level default (least-privilege preserved).

### LOW fixes (CI cleanup)

- **D4**: removed unreachable `'v2/**'` pattern from `on.push.branches` — only the GitLab mirror pushes to this repo, and it only pushes to `main`.
- **D5**: restricted `quota-report` to `schedule`-only (was `schedule || push to main`). Running it on every merge to `main` added noise without value: rate limits reset hourly, the weekly schedule is the actual trend signal.

### Notes

- **D2 residual (acknowledged, not fixed)**: the `http.extraHeader` fix from R53 closes the cited leak vector (git echoing a credential-bearing URL in error output), but the base64 token is still passed in argv via `git -c http.extraHeader=...`, visible via `/proc/[pid]/cmdline` during the push. On GitLab.com shared runners (ephemeral, single-job) this is a much narrower risk than the original leak. A `GIT_ASKPASS` script reading from an env var would close the residual gap if it ever becomes a real concern.
- **Part B (Round 8 backfill)**: confirmed complete — Round 49's "1 CRITICAL merge" is now explained in the changelog, all rounds 47-52 have itemized entries.
- **Part C (D1/D2 mirror fix)**: confirmed correct, including the `ls-remote` + `--force-with-lease=main:<sha>` refinement from R54c that handles the URL-push edge case.

## 0.12.1 — Round 52 (2026-07-07) CI

6 CI quality + security fixes.

- **Security**: `permissions: contents: read` (least-privilege for GITHUB_TOKEN).
- **Perf**: removed `pretest` script that doubled the build (~10s/pipeline saved).
- **Perf**: `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` (~2s/job saved).
- **Quality**: quota-report single API call + single Python parse.
- **Bugfix**: GitLab CI quota-check date command fixed for BusyBox/Alpine.
- **Quality**: simplified quota-report output.

## 0.12.0 — Round 51 (2026-07-07) SECURITY

8 security issues fixed (1 CRITICAL, 3 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 2 LOW).

- **SEC-5 CRITICAL**: vault.ts symlink traversal — `assertPathInsideVault` used string-based `resolve()` without `realpathSync`. A symlink inside the vault pointing to `~/.bashrc` could be used for arbitrary file write → RCE. Fixed: `realpathSync` + `lstatSync` + symlink escape detection in `walkVault`.
- **SEC-6 HIGH**: `POST /api/adr` accepted `body.project` without regex validation — IDOR. Fixed.
- **SEC-7 HIGH**: `POST /api/index` `rootPath` was unvalidated — could index `/etc`. Fixed: leading-hyphen check + `realpathSync` + home containment.
- **SEC-8 HIGH**: `routeProcessKill` allowlist included stale PIDs from completed index jobs. A recycled PID could be killed. Fixed: clear `job.childPid` on exit + only allowlist running jobs.
- **SEC-10 MEDIUM**: `routeProjectDelete` missing leading-hyphen check. Fixed.
- **SEC-13 MEDIUM**: `routeHumanNotes` accepted negative `cbm_node_id`. Fixed.
- **SEC-15 LOW**: `yaml.parse()` called without explicit `maxAliasCount`. Fixed: `{ maxAliasCount: 100 }`.

## 0.11.4 — Round 50 (2026-07-07)

9 issues fixed (1 HIGH bug, 2 MEDIUM perf/doc, 6 LOW cleanup/doc).

### HIGH fix (bug)

- **#1**: `invalidateGraphStatusCache` was never called after re-index. The SWR cache served stale `total_nodes`/`total_edges`/`nodes_by_label` for up to 60s after a successful `cbm index_repository`. Now called on successful index job exit + emits `code_graph_changed` NotifyHub event.

### MEDIUM fixes

- **#2 PERF**: reverted R49 #8 `routeLayout` SWR reuse — `getGraphStatus` on cold cache adds 50-200ms (git log execSync) for a `total_nodes` field the Graph tab doesn't render. Reverted to `countNodes` (~1ms).

- **#3 DOC**: CONTRIBUTING.md + Dockerfile still referenced old GitLab URLs. Updated to GitHub repo + GitHub Actions CI.

### LOW fixes

- **#5 CLEANUP**: removed dead `else if` branch in importer.ts — `wasUnchanged` implies `samePath=true` implies `oldObsidianPath=null`, making the branch unreachable.
- **#6 DOC**: README.md missing closing `**` on bugs-fixed line broke Markdown bold.
- **#7 DOC**: CONTRIBUTING.md test count said 124, actual is 374.
- **#8 CLEANUP**: `swr-cache.evictToFit` didn't clear `refreshHandlers`/`refreshTimers` on eviction — orphaned handlers could schedule stale refreshes.
- **#4 DOC**: version/round refs synced across README, v2/README, ROADMAP.
- **#9 TEST**: (this round) no new regression tests needed — R49 fixes covered by existing test suite.

## 0.11.3 — Round 49 (2026-07-07)

9 issues fixed (1 CRITICAL merge, 2 HIGH docs, 1 MEDIUM perf, 5 LOW bug/perf/cleanup).

### CRITICAL fix (merge)

- **#1**: R48 commit (`8c26fa3`) was never merged into the working branch — the audit was running against 0.11.1 (R47), not 0.11.2 (R48). Cherry-picked R48 into R49 to restore the correct codebase state. The R48 fixes (CI mirror main-only, ControlTab stale controller, parseNote line-by-line, swr-cache timer, kill timer) were present in the remote main but missing from the local working branch.

### HIGH fixes (docs)

- **#2**: README badge URL pointed to old GitLab path with wrong username. CI badge now points to GitHub Actions.
- **#3**: Version string out of sync across package.json / README / ROADMAP / CHANGELOG (all said 0.11.1, should be 0.11.2+).

### MEDIUM fix (performance)

- **#4**: `processWikilinks` ran for EVERY note including unchanged ones — 1000× `buildFenceState` + ~5000 SQL round-trips wasted on a typical sync where 990 notes are unchanged. Now skips wikilink processing for unchanged notes. ~10× import speedup on large vaults.

### LOW fixes

- **#6**: `client.ts` external-signal abort misreported as "Request timed out" even when the caller cancelled at 50ms. Now distinguishes timeout vs caller cancel.
- **#7**: `client.ts` external-signal abort listener leaked on long-lived signals. Now removed in `finally` block.
- **#8**: `routeLayout` called `countNodes` — a full table scan — even though `getGraphStatus` (SWR-cached) already computed the same value. Reuses cached value.
- **#9**: `GraphCanvas.draw` set `strokeStyle`/`lineWidth` PER EDGE — 5000 canvas state changes per frame. Refactored to two-pass batching: O(1) state changes.
- **#10**: `importer.ts` had a misplaced `import type` at bottom of file. Moved to top.
- **#12**: `swr-cache.getWithPhase` scheduled a `setTimeout(0)` on every stale hit even when no refresh handler was registered. Now guarded by `refreshHandlers.has(key)`.

## 0.11.2 — Round 48 (2026-07-06)

6 issues fixed (1 CRITICAL CI, 1 HIGH bug, 2 MEDIUM bug+test, 2 LOW defensive).

### CRITICAL fix (CI)

- **#1**: GitLab CI mirror job force-pushed ANY branch to GitHub's `main` — pushing to `v2/round48` would clobber GitHub `main` and trigger Actions CI on wrong content. Fixed: restrict mirror rules to `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"` only.

### HIGH fix (bug)

- **#2**: `ControlTab.tsx` interval callback aborted the ORIGINAL `controller` (closure-captured) instead of `abortRef.current` (latest). After the first 10s interval, the original was already aborted — subsequent intervals created new controllers without cancelling the previous ones. Request pileup + stale-data races. Fixed: use `abortRef.current?.abort()`.

### MEDIUM fixes (bug + test)

- **#3**: `parseNote` regex matched `---` inside quoted YAML string values (e.g. `title: "a --- b"`), silently losing frontmatter on re-export. Fixed: replaced regex with line-by-line scanner that looks for a LINE that is exactly `---`.
- **#4**: `parseNote` test only asserted `body.contains('# Body')` — passed despite frontmatter being completely lost. Strengthened: now asserts `frontmatter.title`, `frontmatter.type`, `body.trim()`.

### LOW fixes (defensive)

- **#5**: `swr-cache.set()` didn't cancel pending refresh timers. Fixed: cancel at top of `set()`.
- **#6**: `ControlTab.handleKill` didn't clear the previous kill timer before setting a new one. Rapid kills stacked timers. Fixed: `clearTimeout` before new timer.

## 0.11.1 — Round 47 (2026-07-06)

10 issues fixed across V2 + Graph UI (3 HIGH, 4 MEDIUM, 3 LOW). 6 new tests.

### HIGH fixes (correctness + performance)

- **H1 BUG**: `prepare_edit_context` called `getBulkNotesByCbmNodeIds` without a limit argument, defaulting to 1. The flagship tool silently under-reported linked notes — agents saw "1 known bug" when 10 were linked. Fixed: pass `limit=200`.
- **H2 PERF**: `generator.ts` `autoGenerateModuleNotes`/`autoGenerateRouteNotes` called `getNeighbors` per module/route — 200+ queries. Fixed: use `getBulkNeighbors` (6 queries total).
- **H3 PERF**: `routeDashboard` called `countNodes`, `countEdges`, `countNodesByLabel` — 3 uncached SQLite scans duplicating SWR-cached `getGraphStatus`. Fixed: reuse cached data.

### MEDIUM fixes

- **M1**: `ControlTab` replaced `mountedRef` with `AbortController` (was piling up requests on slow backend).
- **M3**: `hotspots` report `notes_count` capped at 1 (limit=1). Fixed: `limit=200`.
- **M4**: `parseNote` `---` inside quoted YAML — defensive check (later replaced by line-by-line scanner in R48).
- **L1**: `swr-cache` refresh timer cancellation on `invalidate`.
- **L2**: `syncCbmLinks` DELETE inside transaction (self-contained atomic).
- **L3**: `ControlTab` kill timer cleanup.
